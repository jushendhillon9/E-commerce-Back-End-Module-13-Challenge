Description: For the module thirteen challenge, I created a command line application, using Sequelize andExpress, that allows users to connect to an ecommerce database. By inputting their information into a .env file and then sourcing and seeding the database, they can run API routes, which include GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE routes, to edit the database accordingly.
