Description: For the module thirteen challenge, I created a command line application, using Sequelize and Express, that allows users to connect to an ecommerce database. By inputting their information into a .env file and then sourcing and seeding the database, they can run API routes, which include GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE routes, to edit the database accordingly. The database includes three separate tables, and each table has five of their own API routes. To test these routes and see how they change the database, one can use Insomnia to do so. For an example of application's functionality, watch the video linked below.
